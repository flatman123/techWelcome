After logging in, the user will have to authenticate
using the Token they initially recieved after they registered.

After registration, the user will need to create a profile
if they don't already have one. 

    GET request ( /api/profile/myprofile)       ***Route for GETTING user profile***
// We'll have to validate the information they enter into the system
// we'll need to check if there is a profile for said user
    (we validate this using the token ( a.k.a user ID ))
// if they have a profile, simply return the json information.
// if not let them know that there is no profile for said user.
// any invalid information will throw a 500-error.


      POST request  (/api/profile/ )     ***Route for updating and creating user profile***
// By this point The user would have already logged in and authentcated.
// They'll need to further authenticate in order to create
    and or update their profile; using their token.
// If the user has a profile, simply update the user's profile
    with the new information and return the NEW information
    , not the old...
    
// IF there is no profile, Build it , then create one for them.
// after creating the profile, push it to MongoDB.
// make sure you associate the correct user with the correct
    profile.

// use appropriate dataStructure to build the user's
    profile


// Create a route that will pull all profiles from the database

// create a route that will profile a user's profile via id
